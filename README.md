This repository contains selected works submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Master of Science in Computational Physics at California State University, Long Beach.

The folder "PHYS 550A Quantum Mechanics Fall 2020" contains .nb and .pdf files of selected Wolfram Mathematica notebooks submitted (or soon to be submitted) in fulfillment of homework assignments.  The problems are contained in the files.

The folder "PHYS 562 Advanced Computation Spring 2020" contains the Fortran, LaTeX, and PDF files and write ups submitted in fulfillment of homework assignments and exams.  The PDF write ups explain how to compile and run the codes and explain the results.

The folder "Wolfram Physics Winter School 2021" contains the .nb and .pdf files of the project notebook "Searching for rules that generate elementary particle behavior in the Wolfram Model". This project notebook was submitted as the culmination of research done during the Wolfram Physics Winter School 2021 and was featured as a Staff Pick in the Wolfram Community post at [this link.](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2162975)
