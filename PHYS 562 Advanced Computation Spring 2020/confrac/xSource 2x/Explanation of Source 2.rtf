\f0\fs24 \cf0 Explanation for Source 2:\
\
Source 2 contains a different version of confrac.f90 that plots the difference between pi and 4 times the created arctangent function of 1 for different values of nn, or the number of terms we use in the continued fraction.  After only 21 iterations of the continued fraction the calculated pi is indistinguishable from the pi defined in numtype.  It can be run using the same Makefile and numtype.f90 files found in the \'93src\'94 folder.  The \'93fig\'94 below is a graph of the difference between pi and 4 times the arctangent function of 1 continued fraction for different values of nn.}
